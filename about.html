                        The School for Poetic Computation is an experimental school in New York City supporting interdisciplinary study in art, code, hardware and critical theory. It is a place for unlearning and learning. It’s a hybrid of a school, residency, and research group.
                        We are committed to realizing the vision of a beautiful school where people who are Black, Indigenous, Disabled, and/or LGBTQIA+ are empowered to share their ideas and study together.

                        We seek to put together a cohort of people with diverse backgrounds and interests who will have a lot to offer to each other as peers. We center people from identities and backgrounds that are often marginalized and excluded from art, technology, and higher education spaces, and look for a cohort with a wide range of passions, skills, experiences, and technical abilities. Above all, we look for openness to building a shared experience around learning, critical theory, art making, and technology.

It is a supportive space where everyone learns from everyone, and bridges are built that continue to be strengthened for years to come. You won’t get a certificate or a title at the end of it, but I would be amazed if you ever looked at your world the same again. I haven’t.

                        The School for Poetic Computation does not currently have a physical location and since Spring 2020 we have been operating and learning online as we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. From 2015 to 2020, we were located in the Westbeth Artist Community of West Village, New York City, on the unceded land of the Lenape people. We studied within the computational history lineage of Bell Labs that occupied that space many years before. We are in search for a new temporary and permanent space; if you have any leads, please <a href="">contact us</a>!

                        All members and guests of the SFPC community agree to uphold SFPC’s Community Agreement when entering community spaces, both physically and online. When we commit to actively participating in the social material of our learning, we can best work together to create boundaries that make it easier for everyone to feel as safe and comfortable as possible.

We will offer subsidized positions in all of our classes, once each one has enough students enrolled that we’re able to do so. We have also started a <a href="">scholarship fund</a>, and we will be offering additional scholarships as community members <a href="">redistribute their wealth</a> through SFPC.

                        We're committed to radical transparency and keeping the public informed on how we make and spend money and we publish our finances <a href="">here</a>.
                        <br><BR>We are so thankful to our generous donors and <a href="">members</a> for supporting scholarships in such a direct way. For SFPC to be the kind of place the community has always meant it to be, it needs to become a platform for wealth redistribution. If you are a former student, prospective student, or friend of the school, and you have the financial privilege to do so, <a href="">please donate generously</A>. There is enough wealth in this community to make sure no one is ever rejected because of their inability to pay, and becoming that school will make SFPC the impactful, imaginative, transformative center of poetry and justice that we know it can be. We know that inside this community there is more capacity for mutual aid and redistribution, and we are always looking for help elsewhere.
